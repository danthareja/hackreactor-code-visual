/**
 * ===== Client side breakdown =====
 * There are a few steps to get all the data we need onto our client-side. Hold on tight, it's a wacky process
 * We need to provide a login interface. Normally this could be a straight-forward $http.get request, but CORS was giving some issues so
 * login is done on it's own page, and is an href straight to the server-side route (/auth/github)
 * After login, the server redirects to a loading page. The only thing this loading page does is call another api route (/api/github/all)
 * that takes 30-90 seconds to make the ~thousand calls to github and store all this data to mongo (Why did I even think mongo was a good idea?)
 * This is a different state to provide a place to put a user-friendly loading animation. After this server call is done, our success callback is 
 * triggered in our loading controller, sending us to the home state and passing in the profile data we got from our github calls.
 * On the home page, we have all of our information tossed in mongo, but not in a d3 friendly manner. So we resolve two more api routes
 * (/api/stats/code_frequency) & (/api/stats/punch_card) that format our data nicely for us, and inject them into our controller so d3 can use them
 * From there, our HomeController has all the data we need, formatted nicely in the objects codeFrequency and punchCard from our resolve, and uses
 * d3 to visualize everything. Was this the most effiecient? Hell no. Was is a fun lesson in resolves and ui-router? You bet.
